# WordPress Plugin Name: NG Create New Page as Draft

Change NextGen Gallery "Create New Page" behavior to create new pages with a Draft status, instead of Published.

## Why? 

When using the "Create New Page" Gallery feature in NextGen Gallery, the new page is 
immediately created as a published page. I don't like that behavior, as I'd rather make 
some quick edits to the page before it's "live" on my site. 

At the time of this writing, there isn't a setting in NextGen Gallery to change this
default value. However, there was a WordPress *filter* available. This plugin uses 
the filter to change a single value. 

## Notes

 * Originally uploaded to https://github.com/tcg/ng-create-new-page-as-draft
 * I made this for use in a larger project site, as a one-off. I offer it here as-is, 
with no intention to grow or support this code. 
 * It's been a while since I've written PHP for WordPress regularly, so it may not 
 completely conform to WordPress coding standards. 
 * You'll notice this is not packaged or prepared for the official WordPress plugin
 repository. As mentioned, I have no intention to "release" and support this code, 
 beyond making it publicly available for those who might already understand and know 
 how to use it. 
 * It might be a decent example of an extremely minimal WordPress Plugin. 
 * Someone else *might* find it useful, and I have no reason to be selfish. So here it is!
